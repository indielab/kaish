//! GH #212: scatter workers must apply the same spill/exit-3 contract the
//! foreground pipeline gets.
//!
//! Before the fix, `run_parallel`'s per-worker spill boundary called
//! `spill_if_needed` directly and never remapped the exit code, so a worker
//! whose output overflowed the (enabled) output limit still carried its
//! original `code == 0`. `gather`'s 0-vs-123 aggregation reads
//! `result.ok()` (i.e. `code == 0`), so a spilled-but-nominally-successful
//! worker silently counted as a SUCCESS row — the exact loud-spill contract
//! foreground commands get (GH #191/#209) never reached scatter workers.
//!
//! Driven through `kernel.execute()` (never a builtin's direct `.execute()`)
//! per CLAUDE.md, so the real pipeline split + forked workers run.

// Test-fixture code: unwrap/expect on known-good setup is the idiom here.

    // clean success. Post-fix, each worker's spill remaps ITS OWN code to 3
