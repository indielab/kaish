//! TDD tests for kernel/job-system teardown (GH #245, GH #247 items 2/3).
//!
//! Before this PR:
//! - `Kernel::shutdown()` called `JobManager::wait_all()` with no timeout and
//!   no cancellation — `sleep 3600 &` then `shutdown()` blocked for an hour.
//! - There was no `Kernel::cancel_all_jobs()` — no bulk lever to stop every
//!   tracked job short of `kill %N` one at a time.
//! - `Kernel::reset()` said nothing about background jobs surviving it.
//!
//! These tests drive the fix through `kernel.execute(...)` and the public
//! `Kernel` methods, never a builtin's own `.execute()` — the CLAUDE.md
//! convention for exercising the real dispatch path.

// Test-fixture code: unwrap/expect on known-good setup is the idiom here.
#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]
